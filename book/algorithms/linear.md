# \\(O(n)\\) Sorting Algorithms

## Counting Sort

```rust
{{#include ./src/algorithms/linear.rs:1:15}}
```

## Stable Counting Sort

It works on generics too!

```rust
{{#include ./src/algorithms/linear.rs:17:41}}
```

## Bucket Sort

> TODO: bucket sort with LinkedList and Insertion Sort / Counting sort / Olog(n)

## Exercises

```rust
{{#include ./src/algorithms/linear.rs:46:53}}
```
