# Recursion

These are just a bunch of recursive functions and exercises, nothing too special. There should be a faster way to write a recursive fibonacci with [doubling](https://www.nayuki.io/page/fast-fibonacci-algorithms#:~:text=Definition%3A%20The%20Fibonacci%20sequence%20is,of%20algorithms%20to%20do%20so.), I'll work on it.

{{#include ./src/algorithms/recursion.rs:6:52}}
