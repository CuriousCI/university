# University Notes - Computer Science 

Just `code` and **projects** for university. All the study-related contents are just a **summary** of the actual material. For better explanations check other material [here](https://sapienzastudents.net/informatica/risorse), study on books suggested by the teachers and learn by **writing your own material** ðŸ˜€

<!-- check [Exyss' notes](https://github.com/Exyss/university-notes) and study on the books suggested by the courses.  -->

<!-- In no way, shape or form, you should study solely on these notes. You are encouraged to follow the lectures, write your own notes, and do exercises over and over again. The process of learning requires effort. -->

>A pottery teacher split her class into two halves
\
\
To the first half she said, "You will spend the semester studying pottery, planning, designing, and creating your perfect pot. At the end of the semester, there will be a competition to see whose pot is the best".
\
\
To the other half she said, "You will spend your semester making lots of pots. Your grade will be based on the number of completed pots you finish. At the end of the semester, you'll also have the opportunity to enter your best pot into a competition."
\
\
The first half of the class threw themselves into their research, planning, and design. Then they set about creating their one, perfect pot for the competition.
\
\
The second half of the class immediately grabbed fistfulls of clay and started churning out pots. They made big ones, small ones, simple ones, and intricate ones. Their muscles ached for weeks as they gained the strength needed to throw so many pots.
\
\
At the end of class, both halves were invited to enter their most perfect pot into the competition. Once the votes were counted, all of the best pots came from the students that were tasked with quantity. The practice they gained made them significantly better potters than the planners on a quest for a single, perfect pot.
